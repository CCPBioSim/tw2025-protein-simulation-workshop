    "# MD Simulation with OpenMM\n",
    "\n",
    "Python has become increasingly popular amongst the Biomolecular Simulation community over the last 15 years. Initially it was primarily used for simulation data analysis work, but with the advent of [OpenMM](https://openmm.org/), it has become possible, and popular, to actually **run** simulations \"in Python\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Amongst the attractions are:\n",
    " -  flexibility: if OpenMM doesn't do it already, you can often write additional code\n",
    " -  transparency: it's not a \"black box\"\n",
    " -  speed (especially on GPUs)\n",
    "\n",
    "The (maybe) downsides are:\n",
    " - You have to \"build\" your MD code before you can use it\n",
    " - Only fairly mainstream types of simulation are easy to do\n",
    " - You have to be comfortable with Python\n",
    "\n",
    "A web search will quickly identify good OpenMM tutorials and guides, this workshop focusses on a quick introduction, and is designed to allow, as far as possible, a comparison with the **Amber MD introduction** covered previously.\n",
    "\n",
    "Being Python-based, most usually you will work within the context of a Jupyter notebook or similar, rather than from the command line in a terminal session, so that is what will happen here.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Build your MD Engine\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1 Import components\n",
    "\n",
    "For this you first need to import the neccessary components from different sections of the OpenMM package:\n",
    "\n",
    " - The base `openmm` package holds the heavy number-crunching components.\n",
    " - The `openmm.app` sub-package holds components that organise the data, both internally and for input/output.\n",
    " - The `openmm.unit` sub-package provides a way to specify parameters for the simulation in terms of *quantities* - that is, amounts of \"stuff\" in specified units.\n",
    "\n"
