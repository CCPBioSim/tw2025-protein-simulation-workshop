Basic MD run:
 - 10,000 steps with a timestep of 0.002 picoseconds (so 20 ps in total)
 - write the current coordinates to the trajectory file evey 500 steps (1ps)
 - write progress to the log file every 50 steps
 - write a restart file every 500 steps
 - wrap the coordinates into the periodic box
 - configure SHAKE for bonds to hydrogen atoms
 - use Langevin thermostat with a target temperature of 310K
 - initialize velocities at 20 K
 - run at constant pressure
